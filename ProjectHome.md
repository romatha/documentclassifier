A Java desktop application (using the J2SE 5 platform and the Swing API) for automatic classification of documents against a given training set. It has been developed, and is packaged, as a Netbeans project.
It uses the stemmers created with **Snowball** (http://snowball.tartarus.org, released under the BSD license) for text pre-processing, **TF-IDF** or the **Bhattacharrya distance** to rank the documents of the training set to the query document, and the **K-NN** algorithm to classify it.
As of now, it only supports the classification of news from the ANSA website (http://www.ansa.it - The Italian main news agency), but the program has a modular architecture, that allows it to be extended by writing plugins for scraping the content of other websites, or other types of documents (PDF, DOC, ODT, etc...).
