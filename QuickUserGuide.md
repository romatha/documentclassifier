# Execution #

There are two ways to execute the program:

1 - Open the file 'DocumentClassifier.jar', in the subdirectory 'dist' of program's main directory.

2 - Open the main program's directory with Netbeans (menu "File"->"Open Project"), and click on the menu item "Run"->"Run Main Project".


By default the program expects to find the training set in a subdirectory named 'TrainingSet' in the program's main directory. Otherwise, it must be specified through the preferences panel (menu "Modify"->"Preferences...").
